# Contributing
To contribute to the project, you need to follow these instructions.

## Collaborators
If you are a collaborator of the Progress-Website repository, here's how you should implement new features:

### Part 1
1.1 Make sure you're on the correct branch (master):
  ```shell
  git checkout master
  ```

1.2 Update your branch:
  ```shell
  git pull origin master
  ```

1.3 Create a new branch for your feature:
  ```shell
  git checkout -b feature-branch-name
  ```
  Replace feature-branch-name with a descriptive name for your feature.

1.4 Push the new branch to the remote repository:
  ```shell
  git push -u origin feature-branch-name
  ```
  Now, you have a new branch where you can start working on your feature independently of the main branch.

Once you've finished the first part and your feature is ready, you can proceed to the next part

## Part 2
2.1 Create a Pull Request (PR):

* Go to your repository on GitHub.
* You‚Äôll see an option to create a Pull Request for your feature branch.
* Select the branch you want to merge into (master).
* Add a description of the changes, and submit the PR.

2.2 Once the PR is submitted, your team can review the code and provide feedback.

2.3 Wait till the PR is merged with the master branch, or merge it yourself if you have the right to.

2.4 Delete the feature branch (optional but recommended):
  ```shell
  git branch -d feature-branch-name
  git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
  ```
  This keeps the branches organized
